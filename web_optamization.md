// Have the least amount of <script> and <link> requests as posible by concatenating the css files and the js files together.

// Put the <script> request at the bottom ust before the </body> tag, it will feel like the page is loading much faster.

// Compress all images.

// minify the css and js files

// Use external CDNs to make parallel http requests without all of them, being from your server
